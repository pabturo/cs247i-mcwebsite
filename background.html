                        <b>Neoliberal individualism.</b> Neoliberal ideology has affected how we relate to one another. Decades of hyper-competition have shifted our collective values. Solidarity and kindness often play second fiddle to the pursuit of self-interest. The focus on personal growth and fulfillment in neoliberalism normalizes the mindset of continuous self-growth, which can lead to self-satisfaction and reduced access to group life.

Of course, they aren’t all lonely. But according to the European Commission’s 2018 report on loneliness, people who live on their own are far more likely to feel lonely, especially in times of difficulty. With almost 70 percent of the global population expected to move to cities by 2050, the situation demands urgent attention.

                        <b>A contactless world.</b> In the past few decades, the United States and the United Kingdom have slashed funding for communal spaces such as libraries, playgrounds, and youth centers. In the United Kingdom alone, almost 800 libraries closed their doors between 2008 and 2018. Such cuts in funding for public spaces pose a problem for democracy. These spaces are crucial because they enable micro-interactions with people who are different from us. Their loss also eliminates the opportunities for small encounters that color our daily lives.

                        Social internet use through social media like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, has made certain groups more vulnerable to loneliness. Let’s take a deeper dive into this phenomenon:

                        On average, we check our phones 221 times a day. Around half of teenagers spend the majority of their time online, and more than a 
                        third of us check our phones within the first five minutes of waking up

                        There are real consequences to screentime: a project at the University of Bristol found that children who spent more than two hours

                        But wait! That doesn’t mean we need to delete all of our social media. Social media can still be used to find joyful interactions and community—in fact, many people do! Research has shown that simply being mindful of your social media consumption drastically improves mental wellness and satisfaction on the platforms. However, lonelier people often engage with social technology in a different way than less lonely people do. Being more passive in your interactions online or using social media in a way that displaces real-life communication can drive up loneliness.

                        British anthropologist Robin Dunbar gives us a tool to think about our relative investment in our relationships. Dunbar established that there are well-defined limits to the number of friends and acquaintances the average person can retain. He noted that each person is able to have 5 close friends, 15 good friends, 50 friends, and 150 meaningful relationships. As the circles get wider, investment in the relationships decreases.

                    <p class="lead text-muted">
                        There is still a question about how these limits have adapted to today’s digital world. Because it’s so common to have social media profiles or online forums with hundreds and even thousands of followers, social media use often extends the number of weak ties beyond Dunbar’s number. [<a href="https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:c8299c5f-a6ce-4df2-b508-f02cd6559bab" target="_blank"><i>Reference</i></a>]
                        This may result in decreased quality of relationships, which has been shown to increase feelings of loneliness.
